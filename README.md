# Bienvenidos a illa island!
Live Site: (https://www.illaisland.com/)

illa island is a place where I put my ideas, thoughts, and creations - from art, to music, travel, and tech.

This creation is the new wave, a celebration of my culture and experiences. I want to highlight all facets of my creative abilities and refuse the stale ideas of what an engineer is and that you are your job title. 

People are so much more than their jobs, their salaries, and their professional facades and I strive to shine outside of those limitations. 

You get all of me, or you get none of me.

So, I hope you enjoy this mini trip inside my thoughts.
This is version 1.5, updated to reflect my growth. Stay tuned, 2.0 is on the way.
